This is a demo app that uses Rotten Tomatoes API to display a list of movies that are currently in theaters. 
Each item on the list displays a thumbnail image of the movie, the title, the cast, and the rotten tomatoes rating.

A detail view shows more details about the movie when you tap on a list item. 
This app uses a single Activity and two Fragments â€” a move list fragment and a movie detail fragment.

This app uses Square's Retrofit as a type-safe REST client.

This app was inspired by https://github.com/mitchross/rotten-tomatoes-demo-with-retrofit
